# Setting Up a File Structure for Your Site or App

## Why You Should Do It

Being organised in general just makes things easier. In your apps you are mainly going to have HTML, CSS, JS and image files. Organising them into a logical folder structure will have many benefits, such as saving you time, make working on collaborative projects easier and have you climbing up the search rankings on google.

## Save Lots of Time

Having your files and folders sorted out into a set structure will mean that when you have to make changes to your app everything will flow more smoothly. It is especially important to have a clear distinction between files that you are working on and files such as libraries which you are just making use of but not modifying. This will not only make it easy for you to understand what is going on, it will make it easy for the developers adding to your app in the future. When it comes time to upscale or expand a logically constructed and named file structure will make everybody a lot happier.

## Climb the Search Rankings

Your file structure will be reflected in the URL names of your site. The following URL does not tell the user much and more importantly does not tell the search engine much.

`www.whatever.edu/depts1/progs2/org004/bio_424.html`

The following is much better.

`www.whatever.edu/departments/biology/ornithology/field-ornithology-bio-224.html`

The user can tell how the page they are on is related to the content on the rest of the site. A search engine will also be able to parse the second address a lot easier and therefore it is much more likely that your site will be found by the world at large!

## Makes Working in Groups Much Easier

If you are working collaboratively then it is essential for naming conventions and rules to be set up. This will prevent a lot of friction and problems that will arise if everyone is working to different standards.
