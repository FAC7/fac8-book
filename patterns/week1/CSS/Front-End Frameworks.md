# Front-End Frameworks

## What? :confused:
A Framework is a collection of tools or components that developers can use to make a project. There are many frameworks available, for instance Bootstrap, Foundation, and Gumby. Although different frameworks do different things, they all try to make front-end development quicker and easier.

## Why? :neutral_face:
* Because HTML, CSS and Javascript leave a lot to be desired, and sticking to vanilla development is not very efficient (even if it does teach you more).
* If you are prototyping and need a product quickly, frameworks will help you get to your MVP in much less time.

## How? :yum:
* It varies depending on the framework you are using. There are different frameworks for HTML (e.g. HAML), CSS (e.g. SASS, LESS) and Javascript (e.g. jQuery, Coffeescript).
* Essentially, these all give you tools to do cool things in your projects without much effort.

## Great! What's the downside?? :heart_eyes:
* You are using code that you don't (necessarily) understand. This means:
  * It may be difficult to customise your project beyond what the frameworks you are using offer you.
  * It is easy to break something because you don't understand how it works.
  * Team members will all need to understand the framework AND the customisations that their colleagues have implemented in order to continue maintaining the code.
  * You won't LEARN!!
* Updates: frameworks are often updated regularly - these may break your customisations if you aren't careful.
