<h3><a href='https://guides.github.com/features/issues/'>Github issue tracker</a></h3>

Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository.

<h3> Why use an issue tracker? </h3>
Software is never finished,you can never test it on every device with every circumstance, so sometimes things go wrong.
An issue tracker is a great way for people to report bugs and submit fixes to those bugs if they have a solution.

Milestones allow you to plan features in advance, for example maybe your getting ready for a Beta launch and you still have features to add. You would setup a 'Beta Launch' milestone, where all the bugs that must be fixed before launch will be grouped. You can assign a bug to yourself when you being working on it, this helps you keep track of your workload and allows your team mates to know which bugs are currently being worked on.

You can also use labels to organise different types of issues, you can then filter be label when searching.

<h3> Mentions and References </h3>

@mentions are the way that we reference other GitHub users inside of GitHub issues. Inside of the description or any comment of the issue, include the @username of another GitHub user to send them a notification. This works very similar to how Twitter uses @mentions.

Often times issues are dependent on other issues, or at least relate to them and you’d like to connect the two. You can reference issues by typing in a hashtag plus the issue number.

Hey @kneath, I think the problem started in #42
When you do this, we’ll create an event inside of issue #42.
