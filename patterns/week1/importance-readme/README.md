# Initialising a Project with a README File

## Why You Should Do It

_Starting a project without_ writing a README is like setting off for the North Pole without a compass. You might get there in the end but it sure would be easier to have that little piece of metal always pointing you in the right direction. A well written README can save money and time, make sure everyone on a project is pulling in the same direction and can even serve as marketing tool.

## A Little Bit of History

_Software projects used_ to be very very carefully planned out, with all the details worked out before any coding actually happened. This is known as Waterfall Design. It was a practice from manufacturing and construction industries where after-the-fact changes were prohibitive costly if not impossible. It was adopted for software development as no software development methodologies existed at the time. As software development is a completely different to construction and manufacturing, this was obviously not the most efficient model.

Recently there has been a bit of a backlash in the software world towards Agile Development where planning is minimal and the focus is on early delivery and evolutionary development. This has tipped the balance to much in the other direction and this is why it is now important to remind ourselves of how a little planing can go a long long way. This is where writing a good README comes in!

## Save Time and Money!

_Writing code means_ you have to pay developers which can be really expensive not to mention time consuming. Writing out a README first makes you think deeply about a project, you outline exactly what you want your app to do which will solve a lot of effort later on. Additionally having a written document means that when working on a team, something concrete can be discussed. It is a lot harder to have a debate about an abstract idea. This also means that your initial README does not to be fully fleshed out, it just needs to be a starting point which can be worked on.

## Make Working in Groups a Lot easier

_As mentioned above_ a README can help planning between group members. Even better once it is finalised and you have some documentation in front of you, everyone knows the final destination and can pull in the same way. It will also allow people to go off on their own and work on extension projects should they feel inspired, with the knowledge that it will not conflict with the initial aims.

## Minor Advantages

_As you will have_ to write one anyway it is much better to do it at the beginning when your excitement and energy are at their highest. Having to do one at the end of lots of hard coding will always feel a lot harder. You will also have some hopefully beautiful documentation in front of you to get you through the tough times!

Additionally for open source projects good READMEs and documentation is essential, it helps people understand your work and therefore make them a lot more likely to contribute. It can also serve to promote your work if it is particularly beautiful.
